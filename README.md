#### Abstract: 
After a brief recap on the required theory we develop an algorithm for computing smoothed approximation
of spectral measures associated to self-adjoint operators on Hilbert spaces. We will exploit the additional
regularity of the measure, which often occurs in many commonly used operators, to derive convergence
estimates and find a way to improve the approximation rate. We also implement some relevant examples on
MATLAB to highlight some experimental aspects.
